# PersonalProjects_LLM_Modelling_ChatBot
Designin a Chatbot for general porpouses

# Objective:
Develop a chatbot using NLP, neural networks, and text processing to address real-world applications. Through meticulous data preprocessing, model training, and iterative improvement, showcase a user-friendly interface with diverse use cases. 

# Summary:
Overcoming challenges in dataset acquisition, we opted for a well-structured JSON dataset. The decision to utilize a pretrained model, despite potentially less flashiness, provided a valuable learning experience. Employing a Keras dense model with 1000 epochs revealed an optimal accuracy plateau at 94%, affirming simplicity over complexity. Acknowledging limitations in the training database's size, a mere few dozen Q&A pairs, we comprehend the chatbot's constraints. This project serves as a commendable initiation, offering a foundational deliverable that balances practicality and learning experience, laying a promising groundwork for future advancements. The judicious choices made—dataset selection, model architecture, and awareness of constraints—reflect a thoughtful approach that emphasizes functionality and learning, positioning this endeavor as a noteworthy stepping stone in the continuous evolution of your skills and projects.

# Accomplishments:
Chat bot is accurate and funcional while following the edges of the information

# Take ways and conclusions
Managing sprints of two weeks were a good aproach to get a tangable deliverable using agile aproach. 
Future improvements, create a web more friendly framework
